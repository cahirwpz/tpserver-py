Actions

Actions are automatic orders.

Actions are events that occur automatically every turn.

They are defined as so:

def do(top):

	top is the top object. In the case for the default ruleset actions, the top object is the Universe.

	WalkUniverse is an important utility function for Actions as it allows you to go through every object in the game.
