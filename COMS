To stop the client from cheating it is not trusted to do any processing of the data.
The server is the only thing that allows processing of data.


The client prepares a map for the server, this maps contains all the client's objects.

The server takes this map and compares it with the main map, any inconsistacies are discarded.
The server then copies across new orders to the main map from the clients maps.

The server then processes all the orders on the main map regardless of who produced them.
Orders produce "results", results are recorded to a results file dependent on the client.
Each orders are processed in the following way:

COMBAT: Combat 1/Bombing
	Combat orders are executed, first round
	Bombs away.

MOVE: Move 1
	Move warp engine half a years worth
	Move gravity well drives to a new system
	Do nothing to jump engines

TRACKING: Tracking 1
	All tracking orders recalculate course for new position of ships

MISC: Mine Laying/Anchor Creation/Misc/Colinisation
	Colinasation happens
	Misc stuff

Population Growth 
	Population Growth/Reduction happens in this phase

Mining 1
	Mining occurs in this phase

TRANSPORT_DROP: Transport 1
	All stuff is beamed down

BUILD: Build 1
	Execute build orders, everything is built as much as possible
	Leftover goes into research

TRANSPORT_PICKUP: Transport 2
	All stuff is beamed up

MOVE: Move 2
	Move warp engines the rest of the years worth
	Gravity well can move to another system
	Jump drives engage

COMBAT: Combat 2
	Combat orders are executed again, second round



A new map is built for each client
The new map and results file are returned to the client
