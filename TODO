Fully python server. Uses a mysql database backend.
 
Supports the following:
		Connect
		Login
		Feature
        Object_GetById
		Object_GetByPos (square instead of required circle)
		Object_GetByContainer
		Object_GetID
		OrderDesc_GetByID
		OrderDesc_GetID
        Order_Get
        Order_Insert
        Order_Remove
		Board_GetByID
		Board_GetID
		Message_Get
		Message_Remove
		Message_Insert
		Resource_GetByID
		Resource_GetID
		Category_GetByID
		Category_GetID
		Component_GetByID
		Component_GetID
		

        Orders actually do stuff
			Move order works (Reparenting needs testing)
			NOp order works
			
        Orders report how long they'll take
        Orders reports the resources used

		Add player tool
			- Adds username/password record
			- Adds a private message board
			- Adds a homesystem
			- Adds a homeplanet
			- Adds random number of extra planets <- These shouldn't all have the same coordinates
			- Adds inital fleet

		Add clean tool
			- Removes all extra stuff added

		Database dumping program. 
		
		TPCL and Design support
			- Can get designs from server
			- Can get properties from server
			- Can get categories from server
			- Can get components from server
			- Can get properties from server

		Scheme Design support
			- Designs calculate properties
			- Designs check requirements and provide feedback
			- Designs correctly produce

Still need to be done:

		Find all FIXME in the code and actually fix them. 
		
		There are a lot of places where hacks have been added to get stuff working. These 
		need to be cleaned up.

		Optimisation and Caching. There are plenty of places for optimisation, currently
		tpserver-py is quite slow and could easily be much faster. The addition of caching
		of many things would speed up the server dramatically.

		Remove duplicate code. There are a bunch of places which have very similar code, it
		might be a good idea to clean these up.

		Make reparenting use a sphere (instead of the current cube)

		Remove Player tool
			- Remove the username/password record
			- Removes the private message board
			- Renames/Reowners the homesystem/homeplanet
			- Removes any fleets

		Fix MySQL auto_increment and 0 bug. May just map 0 to -1.
		
		Figure out how to support multiple orders happening in 1 turn.
		Figure out how to get rid of dummy orders which do nothing.
	
		Add SQLite Support

		Remove MySQLism and go to a portable SQL and use SQLdb.

		Rewrite the permission stuff (allowed/protect) to actually use permissions 
			- Allow people to give permissions to other people
			- Administrator can do anything

		Write a test suite
			- Tests connect and login
			- Tests getting the base Universe object
			- Tests getting one of each object type
			- Tests security (ie get object as owner, administrator, other)
			- Tests adding and removing every order
			- Tests message board stuff
			- Tests manipulating the design stuff (include categories, designs, components and properties)
