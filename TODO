Fully python server. Uses a mysql database backend.
 
Supports the following:
        Object_GetById
        Order_Get
        Order_Insert
        Order_Remove
 
Still need to be done:
        Orders actually do stuff
        Orders report how long they'll take
        Orders reports the resources used
 
        OrderDesc_Get
        ObjectDesc_Get
        Object_GetByPos
 
        Message board stuff
