Fully python server. Uses a mysql database backend.
 
Supports the following:
        Object_GetById
		Object_GetPyPos (Need testing)
        Order_Get
        Order_Insert
        Order_Remove
		Board_Get
		Message_Get
		Message_Remove
		Message_Insert

        Orders actually do stuff
			Move order works (Reparenting needs testing)
			NOp order works
			
        Orders report how long they'll take
        Orders reports the resources used

		Add player tool
			- Adds username/password record
			- Adds a private message board
			- Adds a homesystem
			- Adds a homeplanet
			- Adds random number of extra planets <- These shouldn't all have the same coordinates
			- Adds inital fleet

		Add clean tool
			- Removes all extra stuff added

		Database dumping program. 
		
Still need to be done:

		Make reparenting use a circle

		Remove Player tool
			- Remove the username/password record
			- Removes the private message board
			- Renames/Reowners the homesystem/homeplanet
			- Removes any fleets

        ObjectDesc_Get
		
		Fix MySQL auto_increment and 0 bug. May just map 0 to -1.
		
		Figure out how to support multiple orders happening in 1 turn.
		Figure out how to get rid of dummy orders which do nothing.
