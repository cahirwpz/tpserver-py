Fully python server. Uses a mysql database backend.
 
Supports the following:
        Object_GetById
		Object_GetPyPos (Need testing)
        Order_Get
        Order_Insert
        Order_Remove
		
        Orders actually do stuff
			Move order works (Reparenting needs testing)
			NOp order works
			
 
Still need to be done:
        Orders report how long they'll take
        Orders reports the resources used
 
        OrderDesc_Get
        ObjectDesc_Get
 
        Message board stuff
		
		Fix MySQL auto_increment and 0 bug. May just map 0 to -1.
		Figure out how to support multiple orders happening in 1 turn.
		Figure out how to get rid of dummy orders which do nothing.
