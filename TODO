Thinks to ponder:
	Delete order order? This would need to be placed at the top of the queue... so it deletes the order? may be it should be 
	handled diffrently?
	Delete orders should almost definatly be handled diffrently...

Stuff to do:
	Get mining to actually mine stuff
	Get population growth to occur (what about synthetics?)
