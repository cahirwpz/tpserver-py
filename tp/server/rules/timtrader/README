TIM Trader is a simple game where the idea is to accumulate as much wealth as
possible. You do this by moving goods around the universe.


Some planets have "sources"   which produce various raw goods.
Some planets have "factories" which take goods and turn them into other goods. 
Some planets have "consumers" which just use up various goods.

Your movement of goods around the universe has certain effects.
 - If all (required) goods are supplied to a consumer, the consumer will grow
   and demand more goods per turn.
 - If all (required) goods are supplied to a factory, the factory will grow and
   be able to convert more goods per turn. 
 - If all (required) goods are purchased from a source, the source will grow and
   produce more goods per turn.

The inverse is also true. A factory may close down on a planet if not supplied
with any resources, it will reopen on a new random planet.

You need to be careful that you don't cause a planet to depopulate it's raw
resources. Some sources such as fishing will get their resources from the
planet's population of fish, depleting the number.

Random Events
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Fire,     Destroys X factories on a planet
 - Disease,  Destroys X animals/crops on a planet
 - Asteroid, Wipes out everything apart from X people
 - Strike 1, No production on planet
 - Strike 2, No unload/load on planet
 - Mutiny,   One ship becomes a pirate ship of the same armour/weapons (can not
             effect ships with no weapons)



Turn Processing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Random events occur 		- actions/Random.py
This has to occur here, as it may effect the ability to unload/load from certain
planets.
        
 - All ships unload 		- orders/Unload.py
Unload has to occur before load so that in a single turn goods can be
transferred from one ship to another.
        
 - Loose check performed 	- actions/Loose.py
Check person has more then negative 10,000 credits.
Occurs here as this is the time the person will have the most credits.
        	
 - All ships load (A) 		- orders/Load.py
First phase of loading, allows loading of goods which already exist before
industry has a chance to use them. Useful for using planets as storage
drop-off/pick-up points.
        
 - Movement occurs 			- orders/Move.py
This has to occur somewhere after load (A) so a ship can do (unload current
goods, load ready goods, move towards next location).
 
 - Production occurs 		- actions/Economy.py
Converts goods from one type to another. This should occur before consumption as
it could produce something consumption needs.

 - Consumption occurs 		- actions/Economy.py

 - Growth/Decay occurs 		- actions/Economy.py
Number of consumers (including factories) increases if constant supply of goods
for X turns.  Number of consumers (including factories) decreases if no supply
of goods for X turns. If number of factories becomes zero, industry moves to new
planet at random.
        
 - All ships load (B) 		- orders/Load.py
Second phase of loading, allows loading of goods which were produced that turn.

 - ?Cost? of each item at each planet is calculated.
